            <h4 id="header">History</h4>
            <p class="content">In 1945, Ferrari introduced a V12 engine which became one of its signatures. It wasn't until 1947, nearly ten years after Enzo left Alfa that the first Ferrari model the 125 S or 125 Sport, rolled out of the factory entrance of the Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello, Italy. There were only two models originally produced. The car was entered into its first competitive race in May of that year at the Piacenza Circuit, and on the 25th won the Rome Grand Prix.  The car was set to be released earlier, however, the date was pushed back due to the effects of World War II. After the Modena factory was hit by bombs, the company moved to Maranello and built the legendary factory that it still uses today.
                The next few decades, the Italian auto company prospered with its cars competing in and winning major races including the: Mille Miglia (1948), Le Mans 24 Hour Race (1949) and the Formula One World Championship Grand Prix (1951).
                In the early 1950s, race car driver Luigi Chinetti opened the first Ferrari showroom and dealership in United States.</p> <p class="content">Until this point, Ferraris were really only available to wealthy racing enthusiasts and for competing in races. The location later moved from Manhattan to Connecticut, but the Ferrari market in the US became and still is one of the most lucrative in the world. In 1956, tragedy struck when Enzo’s eldest son Dino died of muscular dystrophy. The 1960s were a time of transition for the company. First, in 1961, members of the company including chief engineers Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini left and went on to form another auto company called ATS. They had intended for it to be a direct competitor with Ferrari at the time. The departure was said to stem from disputes over Enzo’s wife Laura and her heavy involvement in the running of the company.

                Engineer Mauro Forghieri and body designer Sergio Scaglietti were hired to finish the 250 GTO, which, ironically, came to be known as one of the most iconic sports cars of all time.
                
                In the late 1960s, Enzo realized that in order for the company to remain successful and grow in face of competition and market challenges, it needed a partner. In 1969, it found one in the Fiat Group, which bought a 50% stake in the business.
                
                In 1987, the F40 was released. It would be the last model created under Enzo Ferrari.</p>  <p class="content">The following year, he died at the age of 90, and the Fiat Group increased its stake in the company to 90%.      
                After Enzo’s death, Luca di Montezemolo was appointed as the new chairman of Ferrari from 1991 to October of 2014. He was replaced by the current CEO, Sergio Marchionne and plans were announced to separate Ferrari from the Fiat Group. In 2015, the Ferrari N.V. became an IPO and launched on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of nearly $10 billion, and Milan Stock Exchange in 2016.</p>

        <div class="whereAreTheyNow">
            <h4 id="header">Where is the company now?</h4>
            <p class="content">Besides being known for producing some of the best and fastest cars in history, Ferrari is most associated with its symbol the Cavallino Rampante or the prancing horse and its vibrant red color. The red color was just part of a tradition. By regulation, international motor racing cars from Italy were required to be painted red. After the 1960s, it was no longer required, but Ferrari wanted to stick with the tradition and kept it around. Now, it is part of the brand’s overall image. The attachment to Ferrari red goes so far that in the 1990s, at least 85% of owners had the color.
                As for the famous logo of the black prancing stallion on a yellow background, the inspiration came from war hero Count Francesco Baracca. Enzo himself was enlisted in the Italian army during the war. Barracca was an Italian air force pilot in World War I, and on the side of his plane there was a painted horse. On the plane, the horse was red, but for the Ferrari logo, the color was changed to black.               
                The Ferrari brand is one of the most iconic in the world. Since it first began, the Italian car maker has won over 5,000 prizes and competed in tracks all over the globe. When it comes to Formula One racing, Ferrari holds the title for the longest-standing and most successful competitor.</p>

        <div class="whatMakesItBetter">
            <h4 id="header">What makes this brand better?</h4>
            <p class="content">Ferrari is the most successful car company at creating hype/demand/exclusivity. They have taken their race program and built a huge panache from it which Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren have not been able to achieve at the same level. If all four of these cars looked, sounded and drove relatively the same, the Ferrari would often be considered the most desirable. It’s just how it is, and the dealership network has been able to control supply/demand better than their competitors. Nobody in the automotive industry has built as strong an identity as Ferrari.
                Ferrari has lent their hand in helping their corporate brothers. <p class="content">Initially in the early 2000s, Ferrari owned Maserati directly and lent a hand with their motors and engineering support. Despite Maserati rescinding under the FIAT umbrella, they still have ties to Ferrari engineering. Ferrari also lent a hand with the motor and suspension design for the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio sports sedan; in some ways this car can be considered a Ferrari sports sedan. Due to branding reasons, Ferrari could never sell sedans or luxury cars in the sub $200,000 price bracket but via the FIAT empire Ferrari can influence the final product with these other cars.
                Despite the criticisms levied over the years (i.e. lacking performance in the late ‘90s/early ‘00s, styling since the early ‘00s,), the one constant that cannot be denied over essentially the entire seventy year run of cars is that they all sound from very good to amazing, never a bad sounding car. Even the V6 of the Dino and the V6 motor of the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio both sound very good, much better than a typical V6 motor sounds. When one thinks of Ferrari, the engine sound is almost always the most consistent quality the car manufacturer provides, and that can’t be said of most other brands.</p> </p>

        <div class="future">
            <h4 id="header">Where is this brand hoping to be in the future?</h4>
            <p class="content">The Sports series, which currently comprises the 488 and 488 Spider, plus the 812 Superfast, will be joined by a new mid-engined model set to be "a real supercar in the standard range". The rest of the Sports series range will move fully to hybrid power by 2022, with the new car set to sit above the 488 in the range. The smaller Dino, it appears, has been sidelined for now in the new plans. 
                A replacement for the LaFerrari hypercar was not detailed in the product plan up until 2022, but it is understood work has begun on the successor's powertrain technology.</p> <p class="content">Naturally aspirated V12 engines will still be offered, with development of the current 12-cylinder units already under way.                
                Work has also begun on a new six-cylinder engine, set to use a V6 layout with a combination of turbocharging and hybrid technology to boost performance. It is not yet clear which specific models will use this powertrain, but it will be a key component in Camilleri's plan to have hybridisation across at least 60% of Ferrari's range by 2022. </p>
