            <h4 id="header">History</h4>
            <p class="content">On April 28, 1916, Ferruccio Lamborghini, the founder of the company that bears his name and is known for stylish, high-performance cars, is born in Italy.
            After World War II, Lamborghini founded a business making tractors from reconfigured surplus military machines, near Bologna, Italy. He later expanded into other ventures, including manufacturing air-conditioning and heating systems, and grew rich. Lamborghini’s success enabled him to purchase a variety of luxury sports cars, including a Ferrari, considered one of the top cars of the time. After experiencing mechanical difficulties with his Ferrari, Lamborghini decided to start his own rival sports car company, even hiring a former top Ferrari engineer. Automobili Lamborghini was officially established in 1963 in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy, and the same year debuted its first car, the Lamborghini 350 GTV, a two-seater coupe with a V12 engine.</p>

        <div class="whereAreTheyNow">
            <h4 id="header">Where is the company now?</h4>
            <p class="content">Following the presentation of Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Lamborghini, Bayley opened up the discussion by explaining the concept of classic. “It is something final and universal, where by final we mean a concept that goes beyond the flow of time and universal means that everyone likes it.” Then he added, “If we can recognize a city by the buildings outlining its skyline, for example Paris with its Eiffel Tower and the Montmartre Basilica, […] then it means that the design of those single works is so extraordinary and extremely powerful that it makes those buildings different from all the others. […] This is what I think about when I look at the two Lamborghini Countach next to each other: the LP 500 of 1971 and the very latest Countach LPI 800-4. Fifty years of history under comparison and icons of their times, which with an unmistakable style and outstanding performance have earned their place in the automotive Olympics.”</p>
            <p class="content">When speaking of the work necessary to rebuild the original model, Federico Foschini, Chief Marketing and Sales Officer of Lamborghini also said, “The attention and success we achieved when we presented this reconstruction was a clear and additional sign of how this car today represents a legend. What is even more striking is the fact that, without distinction, it attracted different generations, which are usually distant from each other in terms of tastes and the definition of beauty.”</p>

            <h4 id="header">What makes this brand better?</h4>
            <p class="content">Lamborghini is one of the most exclusive car brands in the world.

When asked what car they would buy if they won the lottery, many people’s response would be a Lamborghini. This Italian car is known for its speed, power, and beauty.</p>
            <p class="content">In turn, this has led to it being associated with status, wealth, and luxury. Car enthusiasts are intrigued by how this car is manufactured to achieve such stunning results and would love the opportunity to drive such a vehicle just once. Although Lamborghini is a well-known company and people can easily recognize the car, there are few people who know further details about this luxury vehicle and the company who manufacture it. The company has a long and interesting history and have manufactured many stunning cars. Here are 20 interesting facts about Lamborghini.</p>

            <h4 id="header">Where is this brand hoping to be in the future?</h4>
            <p class="content">Car enthusiasts have a history of electric-car hesitancy. While some are fully on board with electrification and hybridization, there are still some petrol holdouts, especially at the rarified and pointy end-of-the-price spectrum like Lamborghini. The push for electrification and hybrid powertrains poses a significant challenge to the carmaker known for creating striking, bespoke containers for some of the most powerful gasoline engines in the world, and there’s a small sense of reluctance about it from Lamborghini’s top brass.</p>          
            <p class="content">Lamborghini has said it will shift all models to hybrid powertrains by 2024 and already announced one hybrid model, the exceedingly limited run Lamborghini Sián FKP 37 and the Countach LPI 800-4. By next year, the first production (i.e., not limited run) vehicle with a hybridized powertrain will be released, though Lamborghini is still mum on what exactly that will look like. While other supercar makers like Ferrari, McLaren and Porsche continue to make both production and limited run vehicles with hybrid powertrains, Lamborghini is one of the last supercar companies to get into the game.</p>
