            <h4 id="header">History</h4>
            <p class="content">Founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972 and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in 1974, with Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and 1976 respectively. 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by the Marlboro cigarette brand.</p>
            <p class="content">In 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took over as team principal, and shortly afterwards organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era; with Porsche and Honda engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna won seven Drivers' Championships between them and the team took six Constructors' Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant—together they won all but one race in 1988—but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between 1984 and 1994. By the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With Mercedes-Benz engines, West sponsorship, and former Williams designer Adrian Newey, further championships came in 1998 and 1999 with driver Mika Häkkinen, and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, with driver Lewis Hamilton taking their latest title in 2008.</p>

        <div class="whereAreTheyNow">
            <h4 id="header">Where is the company now?</h4>
            <p class="content">Arrow McLaren SP has signed Josef Newgarden’s Penske race engineer and a former key member of Red Bull’s Formula 1 team in the 2010s, Gavin Ward, for 2022.
                Canadian Ward moved to the UK to attend university at Oxford Brookes in the early 2000s, having seen an advert for a course on the Arrows F1 team website at the time.
                Ward specialised in brakes right at the start of the Red Bull F1 project and then moved to electronics helping to develop F1’s first full-time use seamless-shift gearbox. 
                He went on to be race engineer for Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo before moving into aerodynamics reporting directly to Adrian Newey.</p>

        <div class="whatMakesItBetter">
            <h4 id="header">Mclaren Vs. Ferrari</h4>
            <p class="content">At first glance, McLaren and Ferrari might seem similar; they are both supercars that have a pristine reputation. However, there are notable differences and areas where the McLaren is often seen as superior. The most notable benefits that McLaren offers over Ferrari are: 

                Superior speed – McLaren and Ferrari are close to the same level of performance strictly from a speed standpoint, but McLaren is in general slightly faster. The McLaren 720S has hit a top speed of 212 MPH, whereas the top Ferrari models reach just above 200 MPH. McLarens typically provide better aerodynamics as well. 
                A focus on performance – McLaren may not offer the same level of flash and style as the Ferrari, but its performance is arguably better, especially when comparing the two on the race track rather than street driving. McLaren offers faster speeds, improved aerodynamics, smoother suspension and a lightweight ride. </p>
            <p class="content"> McLaren produced 2,335 cars in 2019 (pre-pandemic), which was up about seven percent from the number they produced in 2018. The low number of production (which is done to focus on quality over quantity), makes the McLaren more unique and valuable than Ferrari models. 
                From strictly a racetrack performance viewpoint, the British motor motorbrand has a strong case that it is the top supercar over Ferrari. </p>

        <div class="future">
            <h4 id="header">Where is this brand hoping to be in the future?</h4>
            <p class="content">The senior F1 power brokers are always arguing about what direction the formula should take with the next set of regulations as they seek to improve the show, increase overtaking and draw more fans to the sport.
                But some forward–thinking folks over at McLaren are not concerned with what F1 will look like next year – instead, they have been wondering what it will look like in more than 30 years.  
                The result is their Future Grand Prix concept, with the car codenamed MCLExtreme (or MCLE for short)
                The car itself would be capable of hitting speeds of up to 500kph, would have "shapeshifting" active aerodynamics, and would be electric powered.
                To help the driver cope with such high speeds, the car would also have an on-board artificial intelligence co-pilot.</p>
