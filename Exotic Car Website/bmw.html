            <h4 id="header">History</h4>
            <p class="content">Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] (About this soundlisten)), is a German multinational corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The corporation was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.
                Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced.[3] The company has significant motorsport history, especially in touring cars, Formula 1, sports cars and the Isle of Man TT. 
                BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quandt family is a long-term shareholder of the company (with the remaining shares owned by public float), following brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt's investments in 1959 which saved the company from bankruptcy.</p>
            <p class="content">BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque. The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.</p>

        <div class="whereAreTheyNow">
            <h4 id="header">Where is the company now?</h4>
            <p class="content">The all-new BMW iX M60 is the first M Performance variant of BMW’s electric SUV but, more importantly, it’s the first ever M Division product to use the brand’s all-electric architecture. The only other electric M Performance product is the i4 M50 but that uses a modified CLAR platform. The iX sits on a bespoke electric platform, which is a first for the M Division, who does the tuning work on M Performance products.
                Being an M Performance variant, the BMW iX M60 is obviously quite a bit more power, packing an M5-rivaling 610 horsepower and a planet-churning 811 lb-ft (1,100 Nm) of torque. Admittedly, both of those figures are only available for a short period of time, when Launch Control is engaged. Otherwise, under all normal circumstances, the BMW iX M60 makes 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft (1,016 Nm). However, during launch control the iX M60 is capable of 0-60 mph in 3.6 seconds. Top speed is electronically-limited to 155 mph, like most other BMWs.</p>
            <p class="content">Like other BMW iX models, the iX M60 uses dual synchronous electric motors, rather than permanent magnet motors. The latter of which are typically used in performance EVs but BMW uses the former because it allows the brand to ditch rare-earth materials in its motors. In a time when earth’s natural resources and overall planet health are in dire shape, it’s admirable to prioritize sustainability over power, especially when it comes to performance machines, such as the iX M60.</p>

        <div class="whatMakesItBetter">
            <h4 id="header">What makes this brand better?</h4>
            <p class="content">In trying to identify what makes the BMW brand so popular, one word keeps reappearing – performance. At the end of the day, BMW is synonymous with power and performance, making it the sporty luxury brand that’s fun to drive. Some even say that only BMW can offer sheer driving pleasure.
                Whether it’s the company’s attention to weight distribution, the common rear-wheel drive, or the more responsive steering, all models are designed with performance in mind. The engines are smart as are the gearboxes, that offer quick acceleration, a boosting response, and smooth shifting. These cars swallow curves and hug the pavement, unlike most. The prestige of the blue and white badge doesn’t hurt either.</p>
            <p class="content">BMW spends extra time on designing style and comfort in their vehicles. When you marry performance with this upscale level of comfort, you have a top pick for commuters. People who spend great lengths of time each day in their cars want something that drives well but is also comfortable and smart. The reputation of the brand helps commuters make a statement when they pull up to the office, too.</p>

        <div class="future">
            <h4 id="header">Where is this brand hoping to be in the future?</h4>
            <p class="content">Our success shows that we offer something customers truly want. But, today, people expect more. They expect that we invent solutions to today’s most pressing questions and bring these solutions to life in the form of premium products.
                Sustainability is a topic everybody is concerned about. Humanity faces a great challenge; climate change and resource depletion are real and have consequences. So, our obligation is to ask ourselves: what is our contribution to stop climate change? And how can we do this, and still pass on the joy and freedom of mobility we stand for as a company? 
                We understand the scale of this challenge, and how urgent it is. As a company, we’ve always been at our best when met with a challenge. We have a track record of more than 100 years of tackling challenges with groundbreaking engineering. And we’ve reinvented ourselves more than once. We will use this ingenuity to become the most sustainable car and motorcycle company of them all. Because we believe this is the right future for us.  </p>
